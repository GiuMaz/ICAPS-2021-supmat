Rule-based shielding for Partially Observable Monte-Carlo Planning
------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the supplementary materials to the article "Rule-based shielding for Partially Observable Monte-Carlo Planning" by Giulio Mazzi, Alberto Castellini, and Alessandro Farinelli presented at ICAPS 2021.

In the code folder we provide an implementation of the shielding methodology presented by the article.
It also includes a single trace that can be used to test the shielding (dataset tiger 60.xes), and an already generated shield that can be used to test the POMCP with the shield (tiger shield 60.txt). The subfolders contain a README.md file that explains how to use them.
